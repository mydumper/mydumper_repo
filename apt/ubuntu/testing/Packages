Description: mydumper and myloader MySQL backup tools
 This package provides mydumper and myloader MySQL backup tools.
 .
 mydumper is a tool used for backing up MySQL database servers much
 faster than the mysqldump tool distributed with MySQL.  It also has the
 capability to retrieve the binary logs from the remote server at the same time
 as the dump itself.  The advantages of mydumper are: parallelism,
 easier to manage output, consistency, manageability.
 .
 myloader is a tool used for multi-threaded restoration of mydumper backups.
